## Overview ##

This script receives contact data from an HTML form on your website and:

* Checks for the presence of an input named "mirage"
   - If it finds such an input, it assumes it is a bot trap and rejects the form submission.
* Checks for the presence of an input named "phone"
    - If it finds such an input, it formats the value to ` x(n) x(n) x(n) ...` so all phone numbers have consistent formatting. For example, "123 456 7890" or "+44 20 7946 0808".
* Uses the value of the email field and the firstName field to check if the person exists in your Google Contacts.
    - If the contact does not exist in Google Contacts AND the option (accessed from ContactSheet > Options) **Add Contact** is "Yes", it adds the contact to your Google Contacts.
* Checks for the presence of an input named "mailingList".
    - If it finds such an input and it was checked by the person filling out the form (or has a truthy value) AND the option **Group Email** is not empty, it sends an email to the contact inviting them to join the Google Group.
    - This only works if you already have a Google Group set up. See below for tips on creating a read-only Google Group "mailing list";
* Stores the data in your Google Sheet.
* Sends a notification email to you, the owner of the account in which this script is running.
    -  The reason it sends the notification only to the account owner is that the notification email includes information about the Google Contact entry (if the contact was added to your Google Contacts OR if the Contact already exists). This would be confusing if you send the notification to a different email because the Goolge Contact is in YOUR Contacts, not their's.
    - For information about how to set up email forwarding and forwarding filters in your Gmail account, refer to this documentation:

## Verify Permissions ##

Google may require you to provide various permissions before you can use this script. If that happens, click through the resulting screens in order to give Google the proper permissions.

This Script requires the following Google permissions:

* **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts`**:  To view and manage your contacts (required for adding contacts).
* **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/groups`**: To check for the existence of the Google Group defined by the parameter groupEmail or the UI option "Group Email" (required for mailing list functionality).
* **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request`**: To fetch external resources and communicate with your web server (required for handling form submissions).
* **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`**:  To read and write data to your Google Spreadsheets (required for storing form data).
* **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`**: To get the email address of the Google account running this script (used for sending notifications and Google Group invitations).

## Create an HTML Form ##

* Create a web page and insert an HTML form like the SAMPLE HTML FORM below.
* Enter the App URL as the value for the "action" attribute of your HTML form. The App URL is available from the sidebar that opens when you choose the menu option ContactSheet > Options.
* The form's METHOD must be "POST" ie. form action="[App URL]" method="post"

**NOTE:** The html form input names are CASE SENSITIVE. They must match the same casing as shown below.

Your form can have inputs named: firstName, lastName, email, phone, mailingList, subject, message, mirage.

  | input name | input type  | Required |
  |------------|-------------|----------|
  |firstName   |text         | REQUIRED |
  |lastName    |text         | REQUIRED |
  |email       |email        | REQUIRED |
  |phone       |tel          | OPTIONAL |
  |mailingList |checkbox     | OPTIONAL |
  |subject     |text         | REQUIRED |
  |message     |textarea     | REQUIRED |
  |mirage      |hidden       | OPTIONAL |

## Tips for creating a Google Group mailing list ##

The key points here are to set the group so **only group managers can post**, **all members can read posts**, and **anyone on the web can auto-join**.

* Sign into your Google account
* Go to groups.google.com
* Click "Create Group"
* Give the group a name, write down its email address, and press "Next"
* On the next screen (Choose privacy settings), set:
    - Who can search for group: Anyone on the web
    - Who can join group: Anyone can join
    - Who can view conversations: Group members (or "Anyone on the web" if you want anyone to be able to view your announcements)
    - Who can post: Group managers **IMPORTANT**
    - Who can view members: Group managers
* On the next screen (Add members), you can assign members, managers and owners if you want.
    - Make sure that "Subscription" is "Each email" so an email is sent out to all members every time you post an announcement
    - Click on "Create group"


## SAMPLE HTML FORM ##

**Note:** The form includes an input named "mirage" which acts as a crude bot trap.

Many simple bots fill and submit forms without executing javascript. In such cases, the "mirage" input will be sent to the server.
The onsubmit trigger attached to the sample form fires a javascript function to remove the field before submitting, so when a person submits the form in a web browser, the "mirage" input will NOT be sent to the server.

The server checks for the existance of the "mirage" field and rejects the request if it is present.

This will not work if the browser has javascript disabled.

If you don't want to include the mirage input, you can omit it (remember to remove the "onsubmit" trigger from the form as well).

        <noscript>
          <p>In order for this form to behave properly, javascript must be enabled.</p>
        </noscript>

        <form
          method="post"
          onsubmit="event.target.mirage.remove()"
          action="[APP_URL]">
